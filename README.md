Agents find it much easier to make comparisons across all branches without sequentially making git commits! Case in point:
```
>  can you compare the mock data structure from all extant branches (by find . in the worktrees)? which of them is the newest 
   one?

⛬  I'll compare the mock data structure across all branches in the worktrees to find the newest one.


 EXECUTE  (find /Users/name/ChatGIT-wails.worktrees -name "mock-data.json" -o -name "types.ts" | head -20, impact: low)
 ↳ Exit code: 0. Output: 12 lines.

⛬  Now let me check the git status and timestamps for each mock-data.json file to determine which is newest:


 EXECUTE 
(ls -la /Users/name/ChatGIT-wails.worktrees/frontend-designs/mock-data/mock-data.json
/Users/name/ChatGIT-wails.worktrees/backend-go-wails-svelte/mock-data/mock-data.json /Users/name/ChatGIT-wails.worktrees/frontend
-designs.worktrees/svelte-vite-factory-glm6-aisdkclone.worktrees/svelte-vite-codex-aisdkclone/mock-data/mock-data.json
/Users/name/ChatGIT-wails.worktrees/frontend-designs.worktrees/svelte-vite-factory-glm6-aisdkclone/mock-data/mock-data.json
/Users/name/ChatGIT-wails.worktrees/backend-go-wails-svelte.worktrees/backend-go-wails-svelte-claude/mock-data/mock-data.json,
allowlisted)
 ↳ Exit code: 0. Output: 6 lines.

⛬  The newest file is svelte-vite-codex-aisdkclone/mock-data/mock-data.json (Oct 15 22:40, 16045 bytes). Let me compare it
   with the others:
