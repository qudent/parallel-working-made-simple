# Shell functions for parallel worktree management

# Functions for parallel worktree operations

# worktree_create <new_branch_name> creates a new worktree with the given branch, cd's into it, and runs pnpm install if package.json is present
# the new worktree is at the <current_path>.worktrees/<branch_name> path. This permits a recursive structure of worktrees,
# which correspond to tasks/agents and subagents. merge_to_parent and merge_from parent are made to keep these in sync,
# if you  want to merge from the main branch directly, just use git merge main as usual.

# We try to set up the env as much as possible, so if package.json is present, we run pnpm install.
# pnpm install is better than npm because it uses the pnpm store and hard links to save space and time

# the commands cds into the new worktree and we can start vibing immediately: `worktree_create <branch_name>; claude`` # or `code .`` for vscode, droid, codex, gemini...
# For `code .` on Mac, you might need to install the 'code' command in PATH from the Command Palette: Shift + Command + P, type 'shell command' to find the option.
